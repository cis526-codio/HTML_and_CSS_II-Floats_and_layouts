  <div class="paragraph">While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly rubbing the <div class="highlight">gold</div> piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him.  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the <div class="highlight">gold</div> with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: "Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke&mdash;look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this <div class="highlight">gold</div> ounce, my boys!"</div>

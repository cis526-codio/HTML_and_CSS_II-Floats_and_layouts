That's the end of this unit. We have seen a lot in this one. We have started with two new html tags, `span` and `div` that do not really have any meaning but are used to group things together or to target subparts of elements. This naturally led us to see the display modes : block, inline, none and inline-block have no more secrets for you. Then for the rest of the unit, we have studied and experimented with floats and their sister property : clear. We also saw that using all those tools allowed us to do very powerful and complex layouts.

In the next unit we will see how to make things much more interactive by using javascript in our pages !

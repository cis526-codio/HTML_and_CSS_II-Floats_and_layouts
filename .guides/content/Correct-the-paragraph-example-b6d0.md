Solution :

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Divs and spans</title>
  <style>
    .emphasize {
      font-weight:bold;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1> Divs and spans </h1>
  
  <h2> Don't abuse them : paragraph and emphasize example </h2>
  
  <h3> Don't do :  </h3>
  <p>
      This is <b>nice</b>
  </p>

</body>
</html>
```

## display : block

Here are some examples of elements who have `display:block;` by default. They are called block-level elements : `<div>`, `<p>`, `<table>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, ...

The properties of a block-level element are:

- It will take the whole width of its parent by default.
- It will begin on a new line by default.
- It may contain other block-level elements as well as inline elements.

## What about the box model ?

Block-level elements do respect all the box model properties as we have seen in the previous chapter.

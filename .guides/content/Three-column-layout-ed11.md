Now let's see a three column layout, we have three `div`s and all of them have `float:left;` and a width of 32%, because we wants spaces of 2% between elements.

As you see the layout, at the moment, isn't quite right: all the columns are stuck together on the left, without any space between them and there is a big space on the right.

### 6. [Trying to add line-height](close_all panel=1; open_preview display-inline/inline1.html#example3 panel=1)

We can see that increasing the line-height on an inline element has the expected effect. The whole line, as you can see with the red arrows, become bigger and has a height of 4em. This is some kind of alternative solution to the top and bottom margins having no effect at all.

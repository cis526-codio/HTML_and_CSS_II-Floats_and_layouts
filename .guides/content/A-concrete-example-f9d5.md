We have used a `div` to wrap the whole user panel and gave it an `id` of "user-panel" so we can target it later.

We have used a `span` around "John Smith" with a class `username` so we can apply a special styling for the user name.

```html
<div id="user-panel">
Hi there, <span class="username"> John Smith </span> | <a href="#profile"> Profile </a> | <a href="#logout"> Logout </a>
</div>
```

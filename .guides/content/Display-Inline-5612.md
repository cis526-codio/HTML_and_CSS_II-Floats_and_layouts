## display : inline

Here are some examples of elements who have `display:inline;` by default. They are called inline elements: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, etc.

The properties of an inline element are:

- It will take the width of its content.
- It will NOT begin on a new line by default.
- It may only contain text or other inline elements.


## What about the box model ?
Inline elements do not respect the box model that we have seen in previous unit.

In the next sections we will see different examples to demonstrate the behaviour of inline elements regarding the box model.

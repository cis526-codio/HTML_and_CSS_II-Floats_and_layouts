Continuing on our layouts, we can extend the previous one and turn it into a gallery.

Again the blue block at tom is a simple div with some margin and padding.
The green picture containers at the bottom are all floating left, they have a fixed width of 170px, a little bit of padding and the p inside them have also been styled a bit to remove some of the default margins of normal paragraphs.

If you try to resize the window you will see that more or less pictures fit on one line and the browser moves them accordingly. The variety  of layouts you can achieve with the tools you have learned in this unit is quite infinite ... Your imagination is the only limit :)

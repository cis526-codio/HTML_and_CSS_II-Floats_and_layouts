Continuing on our layouts, we can extend the previous one and turn it into a photo gallery.

Again the blue block at the top is a simple `div` with some margin and padding.
The green picture containers at the bottom are all floating left, they have a fixed width of 170px, a little bit of padding and the `p` inside them have also been styled a bit to remove some of the default margins of normal paragraphs.

If you try to resize the window you will see that more or less pictures will fit on one line and the browser will move them accordingly. The variety of layouts you can achieve with the tools you have learned in this unit is quite infinite ... Your imagination is the only limit !

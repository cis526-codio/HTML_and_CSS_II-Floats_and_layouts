### 2) Paragraph and emphasize example

Here is an example of "wrong" paragraph :

```html
<div id="paragraph">
    This is <span class="emphasize">nice</span>
</div>
```

If you want a paragraph, use a `p` and if you want to emphasize something, use `em` or `b`, like this:

```html
<p>
    This is <b>nice</b>
</p>
```

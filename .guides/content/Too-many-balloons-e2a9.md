If there are too many floats to fit on a line, they will go onto the next line.

Here we have 15 balloons and have `float:left;` on all of them. As there is not enough space to fit them all on one line, the browser will put as many as it can on the first line and then, go onto the next line to put some more until they are all there.

If you try to resize your browser window, you will see that the browser adapts the layout of the floats and the text in real time!

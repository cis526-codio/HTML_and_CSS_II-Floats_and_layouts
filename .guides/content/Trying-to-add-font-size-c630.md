### 5. [Trying to add font-size](close_all panel=1; open_preview display-inline/inline1.html#example5 panel=1)

What do we see from this example?

We can see that increasing the font-size on an inline element has the expected effect. The text becomes bigger and is pushing the lines above and under it so that it has the space to display correctly (You can see it with the red arrows).

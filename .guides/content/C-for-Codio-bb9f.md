On the left we have the "C" as in the previous challenge. 

The trick here is to have the blue balloon with `clear:left;` or `clear:both;` so it will not go up next to the balloons #1 and #2 and again to have the #4 with `clear:left;` or `clear:both;`.

We have played with balloons for a while in order to understand fully how the `float` and `clear` properties work and can be used together to do a combination of layouts.

Nevertheless, don't go thinking that you can only use floats to play with balloons. In the next section we will see how to use `float` and `clear` in order to do full site layouts.

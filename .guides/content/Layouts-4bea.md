Until the end of this unit we will see some classical website layouts and how to do them using floats.

On the left you can see our first layout : 

It has 3 parts, a main content (blue box) part which takes up the full width of the page and is simply a div. And then at the bottom we two more boxes (the green and orange ones) which both takes half of the screen width. The green box has `float:left;` and the orange one has `float:right;`. We have put margins of 2% everywhere so it is consistent and we emulate a margin between the green and orange boxes by giving them a width of 49% each, which leaves a space of 2% between them.

If you try to resize the preview window, you will see that this layout adapts to the screen size pretty well.
